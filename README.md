# passive-attacks
Passive attacks are a type of cyberattack in which an attacker attempts to eavesdrop on or monitor network traffic or data without modifying it in any way. Unlike active attacks, which involve altering or disrupting data, passive attacks are more difficult to detect because they don't involve any obvious changes to the network or data.

Examples of passive attacks include:

Sniffing: an attacker captures network traffic to intercept sensitive information such as login credentials, credit card numbers, or other personal data.

Traffic analysis: an attacker examines patterns in network traffic to uncover sensitive information or to gain insights into network topology, traffic volumes, or other useful data.

Eavesdropping: an attacker listens in on conversations or communication channels to gather information or to gain a competitive advantage.

Passive attacks can be difficult to prevent because they don't involve any obvious changes to the network or data. However, some measures can be taken to minimize the risk of passive attacks, such as encrypting sensitive data, using secure communication protocols, monitoring network traffic for suspicious activity, and implementing strong access control policies.
